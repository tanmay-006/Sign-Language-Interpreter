# SignSync: Sign Language Interpreter

## Description

SignSync is an innovative application that bridges communication gaps between deaf and hearing communities using cutting-edge AI technology. This Flutter-based mobile solution captures sign language gestures through the device camera and translates them into text or speech in real-time, while also providing the reverse functionality.

Our system leverages a sophisticated neural network model trained on thousands of sign language examples to recognize hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements with high accuracy. The application primarily supports American Sign Language (ASL) with ongoing development to incorporate other sign language systems worldwide.

Key components of SignSync include:
- Advanced real-time video processing with OpenCV for precise gesture detection
- Custom-trained TensorFlow models optimized for mobile devices
- Intuitive Flutter UI/UX design ensuring accessibility across platforms
- Firebase backend for secure user authentication and progress tracking
- Interactive learning modules for users to improve their sign language skills

Beyond being just a translation tool, SignSync serves as a comprehensive platform for sign language education and advocacy, promoting greater inclusivity in everyday communication and helping organizations become more accessible to the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

## Summary

SignSync is a mobile application that uses artificial intelligence to translate sign language into text/speech and vice versa in real-time. Built with Flutter, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, it offers an intuitive interface for both deaf and hearing users. The app features real-time translation, interactive learning modules, and cross-platform compatibility. SignSync aims to remove communication barriers, promote inclusivity, and empower deaf individuals to interact more seamlessly in various social and professional environments.
